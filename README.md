# Video Creation & Enhancement App

## Overview

This app enables users to create professional-grade videos by adding text-to-speech, subtitles, background music, and visual effects to a base video. Simply upload a video, provide your text, and optionally add background music to produce a polished final video with synchronized audio, subtitles, and effects.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Convert text into speech and sync it with the video.
- **Subtitles:** Automatically generate and synchronize subtitles from the provided text.
- **Visual Effects:** Add enhancements like fade-in, snowfall, and zoom effects.
- **Background Music:** Integrate optional background audio seamlessly.
- **Multi-format Support:** Supports popular video formats like `.mp4`.

## Requirements

To run the app, youâ€™ll need the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **FFmpeg** (for video processing)
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** or any other TTS service
- Required Python libraries:
  - `moviepy`
  - `gTTS`

# Video Creation & Enhancement App

## Overview

This app allows users to create a professional video by adding text-to-speech, subtitles, background music, and visual effects to a base video. Users can simply provide their desired video, text, and optional background music. The app then processes the input and returns a final video with synchronized audio, subtitles, and effects.

## Features:

- Convert text to speech and sync it with the video.
- Automatically generate subtitles from the provided text and synchronize them with the video.
- Add visual effects (e.g., fade-in, snowfall) to enhance the video.
- Integrate background music (optional) into the video.
- Support for various video formats (e.g., mp4).

## Requirements

To run this app, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (for video processing)
- Google Text-to-Speech (or any TTS service)
- Libraries:
    - moviepy
    - gTTS
    - pydub (for audio processing)
    - numpy (for data manipulation)

## Input

The app requires the following input from the user:

1. Video File: The base video file (e.g., video.mp4) that you want to enhance.
2. Text: A string of text to be converted into speech and used for subtitles.
3. Background Music (optional): An audio file (e.g., audio.mp3) to be added as background music.
4. Subtitles Customization (optional):
        Font size
        Color of subtitles
    Visual Effects (optional): Effects such as fade-ins, snowfall, zoom-in, etc., to apply to specific clips.

    clipX.speed: Control the playback speed of the clip (e.g., 1.5).
    clipX.script: Text to be shown on the screen or spoken by the TTS (e.g., "Welcome to the best video editor!").

[script-settings]

    script-time-exceed-video-increase: Automatically increase video duration if the script exceeds the video's length (True or False).
    script-printing-style: How the text is displayed (e.g., "normal", "typing", "fade", "wave").
    clipX.subtitles.font-size: Font size for subtitles (e.g., 30).

Define global video settings and sequence of clips:

    video-size-aspect-ratio: Aspect ratio of the video (e.g., "16:9", "9:16").
    sequence: Sequence of clips and transitions (e.g., [clip1, wait.2, clip2]).
    background_audio: Array of background audio files (e.g., [audio1]).

[output-settings]

Configure the output format and file location:

    format: Video file format (e.g., "mp4", "avi").
    output-path: Directory to save the final video (default if not provided).
    name: The name of the output video file (e.g., "demo_video").

Example Configuration

[assets]
video1 = "assets/video1.mp4"
audio1 = "assets/music.mp3"

[video-settings]
clip1.video = "video1"
clip1.effects = "snowfall"
clip1.duration = 5
clip1.script = "Welcome to the world of anime!"

[script-settings]
script-time-exceed-video-increase = True
script-printing-style = "typing"
clip1.subtitles.font-size = 30
clip1.subtitles.color = "white"

[video-creation]
video-size-aspect-ratio = "16:9"
background_audio = [audio1]
sequence = [clip1]

[output-settings]
format = "mp4"
name = "demo_video"

Usage

    Prepare Your Inputs:
        Upload a video file.
        Provide the text to be converted to speech and shown as subtitles.
        Optionally, provide background music and specify the visual effects.

    Run the App:
